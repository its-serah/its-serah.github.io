        <p class="ap-experience-excerpt">Getting lost in books is my go-to daily activity. You can check my goodreads profile <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/173541614-itsserah">here</a>. My goal for 2024? Finish reading 36 books, savoring every storyline. I'm all about weaving talesâ€”currently I'm working on an educational book that makes coding a magical experience. It takes a plot and a storyline and teaches you how to build websites through an exciting tale. It's suitable for kids and everyone who enjoys stories and wishes to break into the tech field. Words, for me, are not just on pages but portals to my sanctuary, both as a reader and a writer.</p>
