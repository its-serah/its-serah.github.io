title: Graduate Researcher â€“ LIU
duration: October 2023 - Present
excerpt: Under the mentorship of my supervisor, Ihab Sbeity, I am actively involved in a research project focusing on constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from unstructured raw text, primarily in English. Additionally, I aim to implement this approach in the Arabic language, pending testing and validation. My work necessitates an in-depth literature review and a solid understanding of natural language, entity recognition, and relationship extraction. Leveraging my robust knowledge of Graph theory has proven beneficial in various aspects of the research.The ultimate goal is to establish an efficient system capable of recognizing logical relationships, thereby contributing to a more precise knowledge pipeline.
